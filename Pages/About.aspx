        Building a PC can be quite a chore,<br />
        But the joy of customization is worth so much more.
        <br /><br />
        Selecting parts that fit just right,<br />
        Ensuring that they all unite.
        <br /><br />
        Putting it all together is the test,<br />
        But the reward is knowing you built the best.
        <br /><br />
        Then build your own PC, it's the way to go,<br />
        Customize it just right, and watch it glow.
        <br /><br />
        With a little patience and lots of care,<br />
        You'll have a computer that's beyond compare.
        <br /><br />
        The parts you choose will make it unique,<br />
        From the case to the RAM to the CPU and the heat sink.
        <br /><br />
        A computer of your own design,<br />
        A product of your effort and time.
        <br /><br />
        So take the challenge and build your own,<br />
        And watch as your skills have grown.
        <br /><br />
        So why settle for a computer off the shelf,<br />
        When building your own can be so rewarding and fulfilling, it's worth it by itself.
